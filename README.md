# moca-server

This is the server component of MOCA, which includes the client connector and the service connector.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## Setup

These instructions are for a linux installation. You may have to alter these instructions yourself for Windows, or use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` (this is optional, but highly recommended)
2. Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dev dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
